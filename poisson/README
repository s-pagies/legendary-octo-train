1d_plate.png shows the course of the potential from top to bottom of the 3D grid at the center z axis of the cube (blue circles).
The red graph shows the theoretically expected curve.
As the number of steps in the calculation increases the blue dots approaches the red line. 
The calculation for this graphic was done with 8803 steps.

2d_plate.png shows the course of the potential from top to bottom again. But this time it is a 2D cut through the cube.
Due to the Neumann boundary condition the edges of this graphic look just like the center.
