1d_plate.png shows the course of the potential from top to bottom of the 3D grid at the center z axis of the cube (blue circles).
The red graph shows the theoretically expected curve.
As the number of steps in the calculation increases the blue dots approaches the red line. 
The calculation for this graphic was done with 8803 steps.

2d_plate.png shows the course of the potential from top to bottom again. But this time it is a 2D cut through the cube.
Due to the Neumann boundary condition the edges of this graphic look just like the center.

1d_point.png is similar to 1d_plate.png but it shows the course of the potential that is caused by a single charged point.
The calculation was done with 4293 steps. (Abort condition stopped it there)

2d_point.png is likewise similar to 2d_plate.png.
